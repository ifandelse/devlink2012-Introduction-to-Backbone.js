# 'Ze Recipe Sample App'

This is version 2 of a slightly-more-involved-but-not-much-more than a "Todo" example app intended to facilitate discussion around some of the approaches available for developers to extend Backbone.js in order to get around the "missing" features like higher level view management, structured validation, model syncrhonization, etc.

I have intentionally included what I consider to be good and bad ideas. :-) The point here was demonstrate what it's like to implement moderately ambitious extensions outside of existing helper frameworks. Proceed at your own risk.
