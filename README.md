# Introduction to Backbone.js
## devLINK 2012 Session by Jim Cowart

This talk introduces you to Backbone.js - a popular client side MV\* framework that has gained quite a following since its debut, and provides key abstractions to help you write web applications.  This repository includes two version of the sample application - the first is written in a more 'plain vanilla backbone' approach and intentionally includes many of the typical mistakes I see developers new to backbone make (and have made myself).  The second version includes some hand-rolled extensions to backbone in order to show how certain limitations *could* be addressed (they are not meant to be canonical in nature).  The goal is to introduce the framework, honestly address the gains and limitations, and inspire developers to both explore backbone, helper frameworks and roll their own extensions.
